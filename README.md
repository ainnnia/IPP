Game written in C as a project for the Individual Programming Project university course.

Rules:

The game is played on a rectangular board consisting of identical square fields.

Adjacent squares on the board are those that are in contact with their sides. Squares touching only corners are not considered adjacent. Spaces form an area if one can be reached from any of them by crossing only adjacent spaces. A single field is also an area.

One or more people can play.

At the beginning of the game, the board is empty. Players take turns rolling a traditional six-sided dice. Each player occupies at most as many squares, placing his pawn on them, equal to the number of spots on the dice. A player may occupy any unoccupied squares as long as the set of squares occupied by the same player cannot at any time consist of more than the game's maximum number of spaces. A player who is unable to make a move according to the above rules is out of the game.

The game ends when no more players can make a move. The player who occupies the most squares wins.
